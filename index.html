            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                My objective here is to be able to create
                some websites, and eventually to host them anywhere.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                Until now, I studied physics, mathematics, and computer science. I did as
                a "Maturity Work" a Conway's Game of Life, and then went studying at the
                EPFL, to go afte that at the HEIG, where I am right now.

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>
                For now, I didn't work very much. My first work in the theme of computer
                science is at Kudelski Security, where I learned basics and where I could
                do things that can be quite useful, and how to put them in prod. I stayed
                there for 4 years.

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>
                I am able to program in python, I know a little bit of java, c++, c,
                I can do a little bit of terraform, and I know kinda well MySQL queries.
                I did as a project to link several databases via a python script, to
                store them inside a snowflake database, that was read and shown inside
                Power BI.
